This project is for the Console Programming class at Champlain College, Spring 2012.

This function uses the BandsInTown API with a DLL created in C++ to access the upcoming shows for a band for a given city and state.

It returns the dates/times, venues, city and states, and the ticket availability for all upcoming shows within a 150 mile radius.

To use it, include the BandsInTownDll.dll and lib, and create an instance of MyBandEntry with the parameters: band name, city, state.
