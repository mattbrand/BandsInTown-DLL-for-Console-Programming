This project is for the Console Programming class at Champlain College, Spring 2012.

This function uses the BandsInTown API with a DLL created in C++ to access the upcoming shows for the band Rubblebucket in Burlington, VT.

The band and location are hardcoded just to get the functionality to work, but it can be modified relatively easily.

To use it, include the BandsInTownDll.dll and lib, and create an instance of MyBandEntry with a single string as an input parameter.
